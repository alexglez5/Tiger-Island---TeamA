    - add hashtable to GameBoard with pairs <settlementId, settlementSize>
    - add 2D arraylist to GameBoard that will contain current levels in the game and
        tileIDs of the tiles at that level (maybe skip level 1[will always be the last option])
    - functions that will return arraylists of cooridnates for all the places
    one can:
        - place a tile in level one
        - nuke a tile at level n, n-1... 1
        - place a totoro (using hashtable mentioned above)
        - place a tiger
        - expand a settlement
        - found a settlement
